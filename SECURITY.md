## Report a security issue

The project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [Fastlyâ€™s security issue reporting process](https://www.fastly.com/security/report-security-issue).

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team endeavors to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the disclosure process. The team announces security issues via [GitHub](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-php/releases) on a best-effort basis. Vulnerabilities related to PHP itself are published in the [PHP Security Advisories Database](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories).

Note that communications related to security issues in Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Fastly Security Advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).
