## `createBackend()`

```php
createBackend($options): \Fastly\Model\BackendResponse // Create a backend
```

Create a backend for a particular service and version.

### Example

$options['version_id'] = 56; // int | Integer identifying a service version.

$options['auto_loadbalance'] = True; // bool | Whether or not this backend should be automatically load balanced. If true, all backends with this setting that don't have a `request_condition` will be selected based on their `weight`.
$options['between_bytes_timeout'] = 56; // int | Maximum duration in milliseconds that Fastly will wait while receiving no data on a download from a backend. If exceeded, the response received so far will be considered complete and the fetch will end. May be set at runtime using `bereq.between_bytes_timeout`.
$options['client_cert'] = 'client_cert_example'; // string | Unused.
$options['comment'] = 'comment_example'; // string | A freeform descriptive note.
$options['connect_timeout'] = 56; // int | Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for a connection to this backend to be established. If exceeded, the connection is aborted and a synthethic `503` response will be presented instead. May be set at runtime using `bereq.connect_timeout`.

$options['port'] = 56; // int | Port on which the backend server is listening for connections from Fastly. Setting `port` to 80 or 443 will also set `use_ssl` automatically (to false and true respectively), unless explicitly overridden by setting `use_ssl` in the same request.
$options['request_condition'] = 'request_condition_example'; // string | Name of a Condition, which if satisfied, will select this backend during a request. If set, will override any `auto_loadbalance` setting. By default, the first backend added to a service is selected for all requests.

$options['use_ssl'] = True; // bool | Whether or not to require TLS for connections to this backend.
$options['weight'] = 56; // int | Weight used to load balance this backend against others. May be any positive integer.
